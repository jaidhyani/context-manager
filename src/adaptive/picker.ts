/**
 * Picker for the adaptive-resolution design.
 *
 * The picker is a thin, stateless wrapper around a FoldingSolver: one solve
 * produces the complete target frontier; the picker VALIDATES it (loudly —
 * an unrealizable target is a solver bug, never silently absorbed), APPLIES
 * it to the live chunk set, and ACCOUNTS its rendered-token cost with the
 * same unit model the renderer uses.
 *
 * There is no op walk. Through 2026-07 the picker looped over group-atomic
 * 'raise'/'lower' ops emitted by the strategy; group ops cannot express a
 * frontier that cuts through a summary group (which V2 leveled pins require
 * by design), so the walk oscillated and silently rendered frontiers that
 * diverged from the solve while reconciliation metrics — anchored on the
 * walked state — reported zero drift. See folding-strategy.ts for the
 * history; the walk was removed deliberately and durably.
 *
 * See `docs/adaptive-resolution-design.md` §5.

 * messages have no summary to fall back to and are simply gone.
 *
 * Silent elision here is indistinguishable from a successful render, so the
 * failure mode is an agent quietly missing a stretch of its own history. It
 * shows up hardest on a FRESH IMPORT, where chunks exist but no summaries
 * have been generated yet — every revived resident hits it on turn one.
 * (First observed 2026-07-26: Rhys, a custody migration, lost 126 of his
 * oldest turns from the window with no error of any kind.)
 *
 * Remediation is a config change, not a retry: raise `recentWindowTokens` so
 * the raw tail covers the un-summarized span, raise `contextBudgetTokens`, or
 * let compression run so the middle has summaries to render.
